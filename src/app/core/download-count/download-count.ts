      "body": "# A software tool for calculating energy efficiency for a variety of industrial and manufacturing applications.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) has undertaken an effort to refactor legacy tools that were written for the Windows platform into a modern environment. The legacy tools were written in a variety of programming languages, and the source code considered proprietary. This meant that updating them was a difficult task. \r\n\r\nMEASUR helps manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems. Learn step-by-step ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility. Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and Superior Energy Performance certified.\r\n\r\n*Release Notes v0.6.5\r\n\r\nApplication:\r\n* Fixed: Bug effecting editing Custom Materials after closing application\r\n* Fixed: Bug relating to rollup report side bar links broken\r\n* Fixed: Bugs relating to rollup report printing\r\n* Added: Dismiss option for survey and Beta warning popups\r\n* Enhanced: Re-organized code relating to rollup report printing\r\n* Removed: Rollup report printing disabled until full fuctionality can be restored\r\n* Updated: About Page\r\n* Updated: Acknowledgements\r\n* Updated: Removed acronyms of legacy tools, except in Acknowledgements, About and Home pages\r\n\r\nPumps:\r\n* Fixed: Head Tool Selection button for \"Suction Tank\" or \"Suction Elevation\" both displaying as selected\r\n* Enhanced: Removed cents from cost values in Sankey\r\n\r\nFans:\r\n* Enhanced: Removed cents from cost values in Sankey\r\n\r\nProcess Heating:\r\n* Fixed: Revised Calculation of Energy Intensity in Report - Executive Summary\r\n* Fixed: Solid fuel composition off by a factor of 100\r\n* Enhanced: Removed cents from cost values in Report and Sankey\r\n\r\nSteam:\r\n* Enhanced: Changed results display of costs from $k to $\r\n* Enhanced: Removed cents from cost values in Results and Report\r\n* Fixed: Changed Steam Metric Energy Unit from MJ to GJ (fixes potential steam breaking when convert to Metric)\r\n\r\nTreasure Hunt:\r\n* Fixed: Bug relating to entering zero for BL energy use in Custom Opportunity Sheet\r\n* Fixed: Bug relating to filter modal appearing after a large number of opportunities added\r\n* Fixed: Opportunity Summary table can be cut off in printed Report\r\n* Added: Pipe Insulation Calculator\r\n* Enhanced: Added comma separators to large numbers in Report\r\n* Enhanced: Added filter capabilities to Report\r\n* Enhanced: All Energy Usage and Cost fields to have same verbiage format\r\n* Enhanced: Changed \"Process/Equipment\" in Opportunity Sheet to just \"Equipment\" and changed field into a dropdown\r\n* Enhanced: Changed default Utility Type to \"Electricity\" for Compressed Air Reduction Calculator\r\n* Enhanced: Changed default Utility Type to \"Natural Gas\" for Steam Reduction Calculator\r\n* Enhanced: Removed all decimal places from results except Payback\r\n* Enhanced: Removed cents from cost values in Report\r\n* Enhanced: Workflow for exporting Treasure Hunt opportunities to match Assessment Export\r\n* Enhanced: Workflow relating to Opportunity Sheets in Calculators\r\n* Updated: Example to reflect changes to \"Process/Equipment\" field\r\n\r\nCalculators:\r\n* Fixed: Bug relating to Percent Load Estimation Calculator's Example displaying incorrect results\r\n* Fixed: Calculation of Energy in Natural Gas Reduction - Flow Meter Method\r\n* Fixed: Value of 2-lamp T8 HBF lamp output\r\n* Added: New Unit - Thermal Conductivity\r\n* Added: Tank Insulation Calculator\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Release Notes v.0.6.4*\r\n\r\nApplication:\r\n* Added: Warning relating to results not updating when modifying field values when translating the application\r\n* Enhanced: Added ability to resize the side bar\r\n* Enhanced: Collapse folders in sidebar using icon\r\n* Enhanced: Added ability to sort assessments within dashboard (reflected in sidebar)\r\n* Fixed: \"Click here to export all\" link not working properly in contact/feedback page\r\n* Updated: Small icons for use in sidebar\r\n* Updated: Code improvements for dashboard navigation\r\n\r\nPumps:\r\n* Updated: Result name relating to motor Load Factor to \"Percent Loaded\"\r\n\r\nFans:\r\n* Updated: Result name relating to motor Load Factor to \"Percent Loaded\"\r\n\r\nTreasure Hunt:\r\n* Fixed: Bug relating to Motor Drive and Replace Existing Motor Calculators not properly saving and creating issues in Treasure Chest\r\n* Fixed: Bug relating to Team Summary Table not properly reflecting opportunities chosen in Treasure chest\r\n* Fixed: Bug relating to \"Other\" Energy source appearing in Result Cost pie charts\r\n\r\nCalculators:\r\n* Fixed: Issue where \"Utility Type\" was locked to \"Compressed Air\" for all added equipment.

The legacy tools were written in a variety of programming languages, and the source code considered proprietary. This meant that updating them was a difficult task. \r\n\r\nMEASUR helps manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems. Learn step-by-step ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility. Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and Superior Energy Performance certified.\r\n\r\nTreasure Hunt:\r\n* Fix bug when creating new treasure hunt assessments relating to operating hours modal"

The legacy tools were written in a variety of programming languages, and the source code considered proprietary. This meant that updating them was a difficult task. \r\n\r\nMEASUR helps manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems. Learn step-by-step ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility. Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and Superior Energy Performance certified.\r\n\r\n\r\nApplication:\r\n* Added:  Google translate functionality in settings to translate application\r\n* Fixed: Bug for exporting facility info when \"selecting all\" folder contents\r\n\r\nPumps:\r\n* Updated: Assessment help text for VFD\r\n* Added: System curve equation \r\n\r\nProcess Heating:\r\n* Fixed: Inconsistencies between Efficiency Improvement Calculator and O2 Enrichment calculator\r\n\r\nFans Analysis Calculator:\r\n* Fixed: Unit conversions\r\n* Enhanced: Navigation\r\n* Added: Plane diagram for different plane types\r\n* Added: Highlighting of table and diagram depending on plane input tab\r\n\r\nFans:\r\n* Added: New fan analysis calculator to modal for calculating pressures and flow rate\r\n* Fixed: Compressibility factor calculation in metric\r\n\r\nSteam:\r\n* Updated: Unit conversions to match suite, using units for energy in kJ \r\n* Added: Modal for calculating blowdown rate given conductivity\r\n* Fixed: Inlet water value display in diagram\r\n* Fixed: Wrong table displaying from clicking Low Pressure PRV outlet arrow\r\n\r\nTreasure Hunt - \r\n* New Calculator: \"Waste Water Reduction\" calculator added\r\n* New Calculator: \"Compressed Air Pressure Reduction\" calculator added\r\n* Fixed: Treasure Hunt example being reset when all examples are reset\r\n* Updated: Descriptions of calculators\r\n* Enhanced: Selecting utility types used in assessment in setup\r\n\r\nCalculators:\r\n* Fixed: Many spelling and grammar errors in calcluators\r\n* Fixed: Space between letters and exponents\r\n* Updated: More meaningful calculator descriptions\r\n* Fixed: Floating semicolon in some options for unit converter\r\n* Added: New pump curve icon\r\n* Fixed: Validation for steam properties calculator\r\n* Fixed: Percent load estimation calculation\r\n* Fixed: Flash tank validation be method selection\r\n* Enhanced: Replaced \"Quantity Value\" with \"Known Variable\" label for steam calculators\r\n* Fixed: Ordering of header results table\r\n* Fixed: Pre Assessment Screening result units for Energy Cost\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n* The Mac and Linux releases have significantly slower app start times than windows\r\n* Renaming an export in Windows Download menu can delete the file extension (.json)\r\n* Assessments made in a previous release may experience errors\r\n* Import files made in a previous release may not be usable\r\n\r\nWindows MD5 Hash: 36f6f06647f1b933d4b7b75c0782b4cb"

The legacy tools were written in a variety of programming languages, and the source code considered proprietary. This meant that updating them was a difficult task. \r\n\r\nMEASUR helps manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems. Learn step-by-step ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility. Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and Superior Energy Performance certified.\r\n\r\n\r\nApplication:\r\n* Fixed - Auto updater bug disabling auto-updater for v0.5.0-beta\r\n* Updated - Acknowledgments page\r\n* Updated - Electron version\r\n* Updated - Bootstrap version\r\n* Updated - Removed ng-toasty dependency\r\n* Enhanced - Formatting cleanup for the results displays\r\n\r\nPumps:\r\n* Added: Beta Disclaimer\r\n* Added: Warning popup when a scenario was created in Expert view but viewed in Novice view\r\n\r\nProcess Heating:\r\n* Fixed: Help text for Explore Opportunities was missing\r\n* Fixed: Notes in Explore Opportunities was missing\r\n* Enhanced: Various HTML CSS enhancements to match PSAT and FSAT\r\n* Enhanced: Added help text diagram to several fields in flue gas calculator to better explain how to obtain data\r\n\r\nFans:\r\n\r\n\r\nSteam:\r\n* Fixed: Import Power and Makeup Water Costs were missing from Results \"Input Summary\"\r\n* Fixed: Name of \"High to Medium Pressure Turbine\" in Results \"Input Summary\"\r\n* Fixed: Issue with steam unit conversions\r\n* Fixed: Steam results were not updating properly in Assessment\r\n* Fixed: Issue where scenarios where changes were made to turbines were not displaying properly in Explore Opportunities\r\n* Fixed: Bug regarding copying modifications not carrying over changes to baseline\r\n* Fixed: Issue where marginal steam cost button was not calculating marginal steam costs\r\n* Fixed: Inclusion of $ before \"Electricity Imported\" result in steam diagram results\r\n* Fixed: Issue where HP header warning icon was not sticking to HP header in diagram\r\n* Fixed: Issue regarding extra data generation when making new scenarios resulting in not being able to export assessments with several scenarios\r\n* Added: Steam to rollup report functionality\r\n* Added: Indicators for zero flow to diagram \r\n* Added: Clicking on a pipe or arrow within pipe will put the summary data in the results tab on the right \r\n* Added: Beta Disclaimer\r\n* Added: Warning popup when a scenario was created in Expert view but viewed in Novice view\r\n* Added: Message in report graphs if there are no turbines to generate a turbine pie chart\r\n* Enhanced: Minor adjustments to system diagram to improve visibility of displayed values\r\n* Enhanced: Changed wording of two fields names \"Desuperheat into ... pressure header\" to \"Desuperheat out of ... pressure header\"\r\n* Enhanced: Additional warnings to diagram if steam in header/equipment is saturated, cannot flash water, etc.\r\n* Enhanced: User input validation warnings for various potential input errors\r\n* Enhanced: Ability to zoom in and out on the diagram\r\n\r\nTreasure Hunt - \r\n* New Feature - Treasure Hunt Calculators - allows users to estimate the energy savings for various opportunities and compare current energy use throughout facility to that after opportunity implementation\r\n\r\nCalculators:\r\n* Fixed: Several bugs relating Pump/Fan and System curves\r\n* Fixed: Bug where the decimal point was not recognized in replace/rewind motor calculator\r\n* Added: Cost of electricity/fuel and cost savings to various calculator (lighting, replace motors, etc.)\r\n* Added: Electricity, natural gas, and compressed air reduction calculators\r\n* Enhanced: Combined replace/rewind motor calculator and replace motor calculators\r\n* Enhanced: Several calculators to fit into the Treasure Hunt (lighting, replace motors, etc.)\r\n* Enhanced: Description of Combined Heat and Power Calculator\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n* The calculations for the Steam application will take longer than the others due to its iterative calculations\r\n* The Mac and Linux releases have significantly slower app start times than in previous builds\r\n* Renaming an export in Windows Download menu can delete the file extension (.json)\r\n* Assessments made in a previous release may experience errors\r\n* Import files made in a previous release will not be useable"

The legacy tools were written in a variety of programming languages, and the source code considered proprietary. This meant that updating them was a difficult task. \r\n\r\nMEASUR helps manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems. Learn step-by-step ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility. Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and Superior Energy Performance certified.\r\n\r\n\r\nApplication:\r\n* Updated - Acknowledgments page\r\n* Updated - Electron version\r\n* Updated - Bootstrap version\r\n* Updated - Removed ng-toasty dependency\r\n* Enhanced - Formatting cleanup for the results displays\r\n\r\nPumps:\r\n* Added: Beta Disclaimer\r\n* Added: Warning popup when a scenario was created in Expert view but viewed in Novice view\r\n\r\nProcess Heating:\r\n* Fixed: Help text for Explore Opportunities was missing\r\n* Fixed: Notes in Explore Opportunities was missing\r\n* Enhanced: Various HTML CSS enhancements to match PSAT and FSAT\r\n* Enhanced: Added help text diagram to several fields in flue gas calculator to better explain how to obtain data\r\n\r\nFans:\r\n\r\n\r\nSteam:\r\n* Fixed: Import Power and Makeup Water Costs were missing from Results \"Input Summary\"\r\n* Fixed: Name of \"High to Medium Pressure Turbine\" in Results \"Input Summary\"\r\n* Fixed: Issue with steam unit conversions\r\n* Fixed: Steam results were not updating properly in Assessment\r\n* Fixed: Issue where scenarios where changes were made to turbines were not displaying properly in Explore Opportunities\r\n* Fixed: Bug regarding copying modifications not carrying over changes to baseline\r\n* Fixed: Issue where marginal steam cost button was not calculating marginal steam costs\r\n* Fixed: Inclusion of $ before \"Electricity Imported\" result in steam diagram results\r\n* Fixed: Issue where HP header warning icon was not sticking to HP header in diagram\r\n* Fixed: Issue regarding extra data generation when making new scenarios resulting in not being able to export assessments with several scenarios\r\n* Added: Steam to rollup report functionality\r\n* Added: Indicators for zero flow to diagram \r\n* Added: Clicking on a pipe or arrow within pipe will put the summary data in the results tab on the right \r\n* Added: Beta Disclaimer\r\n* Added: Warning popup when a scenario was created in Expert view but viewed in Novice view\r\n* Added: Message in report graphs if there are no turbines to generate a turbine pie chart\r\n* Enhanced: Minor adjustments to system diagram to improve visibility of displayed values\r\n* Enhanced: Changed wording of two fields names \"Desuperheat into ... pressure header\" to \"Desuperheat out of ... pressure header\"\r\n* Enhanced: Additional warnings to diagram if steam in header/equipment is saturated, cannot flash water, etc.\r\n* Enhanced: User input validation warnings for various potential input errors\r\n* Enhanced: Ability to zoom in and out on the diagram\r\n\r\nTreasure Hunt - \r\n* New Feature - Treasure Hunt Calculators - allows users to estimate the energy savings for various opportunities and compare current energy use throughout facility to that after opportunity implementation\r\n\r\nCalculators:\r\n* Fixed: Several bugs relating Pump/Fan and System curves\r\n* Fixed: Bug where the decimal point was not recognized in replace/rewind motor calculator\r\n* Added: Cost of electricity/fuel and cost savings to various calculator (lighting, replace motors, etc.)\r\n* Added: Electricity, natural gas, and compressed air reduction calculators\r\n* Enhanced: Combined replace/rewind motor calculator and replace motor calculators\r\n* Enhanced: Several calculators to fit into the Treasure Hunt (lighting, replace motors, etc.)\r\n* Enhanced: Description of Combined Heat and Power Calculator\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n* The calculations for the Steam application will take longer than the others due to its iterative calculations\r\n* The Mac and Linux releases have significantly slower app start times than in previous builds\r\n* Renaming an export in Windows Download menu can delete the file extension (.json)\r\n* Assessments made in a previous release may experience errors\r\n* Import files made in a previous release will not be useable\r\n"

      "body": "# A software tool for calculating energy efficiency for a variety of industrial and manufacturing applications.\r\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) has undertaken an effort to refactor legacy tools that were written for the Windows platform into a modern environment. The legacy tools were written in a variety of programming languages, and the source code considered proprietary. This meant that updating them was a difficult task. \r\nMEASUR helps manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems. Learn step-by-step ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility. Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and Superior Energy Performance certified.\r\n\r\n**Application:**\r\n* Added: Popup to home page to ask for tool feedback\r\n* Added: Tutorial Setting for \"All Hide/Show\"\r\n* Enhanced: Changed name of \"Contact\" page to \"Feedback\" and added link for tool feedback survey\r\n* Enhanced: Style updates for consistency throughout the tool\r\n* Enhanced: Added button for \"Copy Table\" to most tables throughout tool\r\n* Enhanced: Esc button now closes popup graphs\r\n* Fixed: Several grammar/spelling issues in tool\r\n\r\n**Pumps:**\r\n* Fixed: Bug relating to using the backspace to clear the name of a new scenario in Explore Opportunities\r\n* Fixed: Clarified that \"Cost\" field in Field Data is \"Electricity Cost\"\r\n\r\n**Process Heating:**\r\n* Enhanced: Help text for \"Number of Phases\" in Aux Equipment\r\n* Fixed: Updated field title for \"Motor Phase\" field in Aux Equipment to \"Number of Phases\"\r\n\r\n**Fans:**\r\n* Fixed: Updated field title for \"Cost\" field in Field Data to \"Electricity Cost\"\r\n\r\n**Steam:**\r\n* New Feature - Steam System Modeling Tool - allows users to compare current steam systems to modified scenarios to analyze potential energy savings\r\n* Added - Steam Reports and dynamic diagram\r\n\r\n**Calculators:**\r\n* Added: Lighting Calculator to home screen\r\n* Enhanced: Styling of Motor - Replace/Rewind to fit into the Treasure Hunt Styling\r\n* Enhanced: Help text for Compressed Air - Bag Method calculator and Compressed Air - System Capacity calculator\r\n* Enhanced: Reduced the maximum width of the unit converter calculator\r\n* Enhanced: Set the right side of the unit converter to a result instead of an updating input field\r\n* Enhanced: Styling of Motor - Replace Existing motor to fit into the Treasure Hunt Styling\r\n* Enhanced: Calculator help text for Process Heating - O2 Enrichment & Efficiency Improvement\r\n* Fixed: Bug where field help text was not always showing up in pre-assessment calculator\r\n* Fixed: Bug in pump & fan curves and system curves where tool was not converting from non-standard imperial units before sending it to the suite for calculations\r\n* Fixed: Suite bug where the Steam - Flash Tank calculator would not properly identify if incoming steam was superheated or saturated, leading to errors\r\n* Fixed: Several small bugs relating to calculator icons\r\n* Fixed: Bug relating to the Fan - Fan Analysis calculator not allowing progression when using \"Use Custom Density\"\r\n\r\n**Known Issues:**\r\n* The calculations for the Steam application will take longer than the others due to its iterative calculations\r\n* The Mac and Linux releases have significantly slower app start times than in previous builds\r\n* Renaming an export in Windows Download menu can delete the file extension (.json)\r\n* Assessments made in a previous release may experience errors\r\n* Import files made in a previous release will not be useable"

      "body": "# A software tool for calculating energy efficiency for a variety of industrial and manufacturing applications.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) has undertaken an effort to refactor legacy tools that were written for the Windows platform into a modern environment. The legacy tools were written in a variety of programming languages, and the source code considered proprietary. This meant that updating them was a difficult task. \r\n\r\nAMO’s tools help manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems. Learn step-by-step ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility. Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and Superior Energy Performance certified.\r\n\r\nApplication:\r\n* Fixed: Changed name of the tool as it appears in Start Menus to MEASUR\r\n\r\nPumps:\r\n* Fixed: Several bugs regarding warnings\r\nProcess Heating:\r\n\r\nFans:\r\n* Fixed: Several bugs regarding warnings\r\n\r\nCalculators:\r\n* Enhanced: Validation logic and warnings for pump and fan calculators\r\n* Fixed: Bug regarding calculation of fluid power for pump curve, fan curve and the two system curve calculators\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n* The Mac and Linux releases have significantly slower app start times than in previous builds\r\n* Renaming an export in Windows Download menu can delete the file extension (.json)\r\n* Assessments made in a previous release may experience errors\r\n* Import files made in a previous release will not be useable"

      "body": "﻿# A software tool for calculating energy efficiency for a variety of industrial and manufacturing applications.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) has undertaken an effort to refactor legacy tools that were written for the Windows platform into a modern environment. The legacy tools were written in a variety of programming languages, and the source code considered proprietary. This meant that updating them was a difficult task. \r\n\r\nAMO’s tools help manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems. Learn step-by-step ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility. Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and Superior Energy Performance certified.\r\n\r\nApplication:\r\n* Fixed: Issue where pre-assessments were automatically checked when navigated to a folder\r\n* Added: Access to the Unit Converter Calculator within Assessments\r\n* Added: Ability to set if tutorials are on/off in General Settings\r\n* Added: Print options for Rollup reports\r\n* Enhanced: Ensured that values in Assessment Calculators are copied when copy the Assessment\r\n\r\nPumps:\r\n* Added: Ability for users to define drive efficiency\r\n* Added: Load Fraction and Drive Efficiency as results\r\n* Enhanced: Electricity price defined in folder is applied to default value in new assessments\r\n* Enhanced: Removed \"Operating Fraction\" and replaced with \"Operating Hours\"\r\n* Enhanced: Revamped Explore Opportunities to feature energy savings opportunities as starting points for a scenario\r\n* Enhanced: Revamped the Optimization procedure.  Only pump is optimized via link. In a modification can either enter a pump efficiency (with the efficiency calculated in the baseline as a default value) or \"optimize pump\"\r\n\r\nProcess Heating:\r\n* Fixed: Bug relating to help text initialization for Design Energy Use and Metered Energy\r\n* Added: Help text for \"Flow Rate During Collection\" in Metered Energy\r\n\r\nFans:\r\n* Fixed: Bug relating to tool not allowing progression from Fan tab\r\n* Fixed: Bug stopping calculator from appearing in assessment\r\n* Fixed: Issues regarding Report Input Data\r\n* Fixed: Issues regarding metric units for Fan Rated Motor Power\r\n* Added: Ability for users to define drive efficiency\r\n* Added: Load Fraction and Drive Efficiency as results\r\n* Enhanced: Electricity price defined in folder is applied to default value in new assessments\r\n* Enhanced: Removed \"Operating Fraction\" and replaced with \"Operating Hours\"\r\n* Enhanced: Revamped Explore Opportunities to feature energy savings opportunities as starting points for a scenario\r\n* Enhanced: Revamped the Optimization procedure.  Only fan is optimized via link. In a modification can either enter a fan efficiency (with the efficiency calculated in the baseline as a default value) or \"optimize fan\"\r\n\r\nCalculators:\r\n* Fixed: Issue with extra lines appearing on Fan Curve Calculator Graph\r\n\r\n* Fixed: Issues with results in Pneumatic Cylinder Air Requirement Calculator\r\n* Fixed: Names, links, and order of calculators in lists\r\n* Fixed: General issues regarding the System Curve Calculator\r\n* Fixed: General issues regarding the Pump Curve Calculator\r\n* Fixed: General issues regarding the Fan Curve Calculator\r\n* Fixed: Issue in pump/fan curves where table headers were offset\r\n* Fixed: Bug relating to calculations within System Curve\r\n* Added: Help text for fields in Pneumatic Cylinder Air Requirement Calculator\r\n* Added: Max flow for pump/fan curves\r\n* Added: Boiler Combustion Efficiency as a result in the Stack Loss Calculator\r\n* Added: Automatic population of Pump/Fan Curve Table with the intersection points between pump/fan and system curves\r\n* Added: kgal unit to unit converter\r\n* Added: Receiver Tank - Usable Air Capacity Calculator\r\n* Enhanced: Gave the results of the unit converter 6 significant digits\r\n* Removed: Receiver Tank - Usable Air Capacity from Receiver Tank - Size Calculator\r\n* Removed: \"Explore\" Section of Pump/Fan Curve Calculators\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n* The Mac and Linux releases have significantly slower app start times than in previous builds\r\n* Renaming an export in Windows Download menu can delete the file extension (.json)\r\n* Assessments made in a previous release may experience errors\r\n* Import files made in a previous release will not be useable"

      "body": "# A software tool for calculating energy efficiency for a variety of industrial and manufacturing applications.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) has undertaken an effort to refactor legacy tools that were written for the Windows platform into a modern environment. The legacy tools were written in a variety of programming languages, and the source code considered proprietary. This meant that updating them was a difficult task. \r\n\r\nAMO’s tools help manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems. Learn step-by-step ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility. Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and Superior Energy Performance certified.\r\n\r\nApplication:\r\n* Added: Pump, Fan, and Process Heating Assessment and Dashboard Tutorials to Tutorials Page and throughout assessment\r\n* Added: System Restore Button to delete all assessments, clear custom databases, restore settings, restore examples\r\n* Added: Calculator data within assessments is saved with the assessment\r\n* Updated: List of contributors to tool\r\n* Fixed: FSAT summaries no longer show up in Printed rollup reports if there are no assessments of that type\r\n* Fixed: Typos, Style and bug fixes\r\n* Removed: `Delete All Assessments` Button\r\n\r\nPumps:\r\n* Enhanced: Badges update in response to warnings\r\n* Enhanced: Removed dropdown menus for Rated Motor Power so can use non-standard values\r\n* Fixed: Calculation for optimized/modified current and power factor\r\n\r\nProcess Heating:\r\n* Enhanced: Badges update in response to warnings\r\n* Fixed: Calculation errrs in EAF Energy Input\r\n* Fixed: Behavior issues with Cooling losses in Explore Opportunities\r\n* Removed: Incorrect display of warning for non-EAF electrotechnologies\r\n\r\nFans:\r\n* Added: Added Fans to the Rollup reports\r\n* Added: Added report functionality\r\n* Fixed: Fan and Pump summary energy units from kWh to MWh\r\n* Enhanced: Added tooltips to the badges\r\n* Enhanced: Badges update in response to warnings\r\n* Enhanced: Removed dropdown menus for Rated Motor Power so can use non-standard values\r\n\r\nCalculators:\r\n* Added: Calculator for quantifying savings from switching lighting \r\n* Added: Calculator for quantifying CO2 emissions and savings for different energy sources\r\n* Added: All data in calculators now remain when navigating away from page\r\n* Added: Button to copy all data in graph results tables for exporting to Excel or similar programs.\r\n* Added: Metric units for compressed air\r\n* Added: Button to reset calculator data to original state\r\n* Enhanced: Added icons for calculators from the Steam System Modeling Tool (boiler, turbine, etc.)\r\n* Enhanced: Added ability to add more leaks in Bag Method - Leak Loss Calculator\r\n* Fixed: Cleaned up code pertaining to line graphs\r\n* Fixed: Improved functionality of the combined pump/fan and system curve\r\n* Fixed: Bug relating to calcualtion of motor drive efficiency\r\n* Fixed: Several instances of incorrectly displayed units in calculators\r\n* Fixed: Bug relating to calcuation of modifications to pump and fan curves\r\n* Removed: Pneumatic valve flow factor calculator until further fixes are made\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n* The Mac and Linux releases have significantly slower app start times than in previous builds\r\n* Renaming an export in Windows Download menu can delete the file extension (.json)\r\n* Assessments made in a previous release may experience errors\r\n* Import files made in a previous release will not be useable"

      "body": "# A software tool for calculating energy efficiency for a variety of industrial and manufacturing applications.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) has undertaken an effort to refactor legacy tools that were written for the Windows platform into a modern environment. The legacy tools were written in a variety of programming languages, and the source code considered proprietary.

      "body": "# A software tool for calculating energy efficiency for a variety of industrial and manufacturing applications.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) has undertaken an effort to refactor legacy tools that were written for the Windows platform into a modern environment. The legacy tools were written in a variety of programming languages, and the source code considered proprietary. This meant that updating them was a difficult task. \r\n\r\nAMO’s tools help manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems. Learn step-by-step ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility. Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and Superior Energy Performance certified.\r\n\r\nApplication:\r\n* Enhanced: Added absolute temperature scales (Kelvin and Rankine) to unit converter\r\n* Added: Ability to rename an export within the export box to reduce possibility of deleting the .json from the file name in windows\r\n* Updated: Top bar navigation.  The House Icon directs to the home screen; the folder icon directs to \"All Assessments\"\r\n\r\nPumps:\r\n* Fixed: General bug and text fixes\r\n* Enhanced: Added results to the right side of System Setup - Field Data\r\n\r\nProcess Heating:\r\n* Fixed: General bug and text fixes\r\n* Fixed: Navigation - Next button on \"Other Losses\" page of System Setup now directs to \"Aux Equipment\"\r\n* Enhanced: Added % Savings graphs to Executive Summary\r\n\r\nFans:\r\n* New Feature: Fan Assessment Tool- similar to the pump tool, this allows users to compare current fan setups to modification scenarios to analyze potential savings\r\n* Added: Popup calculators for estimating fan inlet/outlet pressures based on estimations of system losses\r\n* Added: Popup calculator for the calculation of fan inlet and outlet pressures and flow based on a pitot tube traverse in accordance with AMCA 203\r\n* Added: Fan Reports and Sankeys\r\n\r\nCalculators:\r\n* Added: Replace Motor Calculator - Calculate the energy savings, cost savings, and payback period for replacing an existing motor with a higher efficiency motor.\r\n* Added: Replace vs. Rewind Calculator - Compare the cost and energy expenditure of rewinding a failed motor versus replacing it with a new energy-efficient model.\r\n* Added: Operating points calculator - Calculation of fan inlet and outlet pressures, flow, and energy use based on a pitot tube traverse in accordance with AMCA 203\r\n* Added: Fan curve calculator - Develop fan curves, adopted from pump curve calculator\r\n* Added: System curve calculator - to develop fan system curves, adopted from pump system curve calculator\r\n* Enhanced: Steam Properties and Saturated Properties graphs - smoothed constant temperature lines\r\n* Enhanced: Added popup modals to many calculator graphs to enlarge graphs\r\n* Enhanced: Added ability to click on line graphs and create a table with the data\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n* The Mac and Linux releases have significantly slower app start times than in previous builds\r\n* Renaming an export in Windows Download menu can delete the file extension (.json)\r\n* Assessments made in a previous release may experience errors\r\n* Import files made in a previous release will not be useable"

      "body": "# A software tool for calculating energy efficiency for a variety of industrial and manufacturing applications.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) has undertaken an effort to refactor legacy tools that were written for the Windows platform into a modern environment. The legacy tools were written in a variety of programming languages, and the source code considered proprietary. This meant that updating them was a difficult task. \r\n\r\nAMO’s tools help manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems. Learn step-by-step ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility. Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and Superior Energy Performance certified.\r\n\r\nApplication:\r\n* Enhanced: Made facility info more prominent and collapsible\r\n* Fixed: Problems with Import/Export Functionality\r\n* Added: The ability to Import/Export pre-assessments\r\n* Added: The ability to copy assessments (with or without scenarios)\r\n* Enhanced: Pre-assessments can now be used for pumps or process heating\r\n* Enhanced: Pre-assessments energy source is non-exclusive (can be both fuel and electricity)\r\n* Enhanced: Ease of creating new scenarios and a “quick add” for Explore Opportunities\r\n* Added: Custom Material Management page and ability to import/export custom materials\r\n* Fixed: Various Bug fixes\r\n\r\nPSAT:\r\n* Disabled: Ability to optimize with a not-fixed specific speed\r\n* Fixed: Various Bug fixes\r\n\r\nPHAST:\r\n* Updated: PHAST Explore Opportunities page\r\n* Enhanced: Unit choices and decimal places shown\r\n* Added: Various warnings for invalid data entry\r\n* Added: Fuel composition to Input Data Report\r\n* Enhanced: Verbiage relating to reactions\r\n* Enhanced: Electrotechnology Energy Input Results now calculate amount of electrical power requred in addition to fuel input\r\n* Enhanced: Electrotechnology Sankey's include breakdown of electricty and chemical inputs\r\n* Enhanced: Added label to Sankey if there is added energy via an exothermic reaction\r\n* Enhanced: Metered and Design Energy can model hybrid energy sources \r\n* Returned: Ability to add multiple cooling losses\r\n* Fixed: Various Bug fixes\r\n\r\n\r\nCalculators:\r\n* Added: Steam and Saturated Fluid Properties Calculators\r\n* Added: Motor Drive Comparison Calculator\r\n* Added: New method for Load Estimation Calculator\r\n* Added: Power Factor Correction Calculator\r\n* Fixed: Various Bug fixes\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n* The Mac and Linux releases have significantly slower app start times than in previous builds\r\n* Assessments made in a previous release may experience errors\r\n* Import files made in a previous release will not be useable"

      "body": "# A software tool for calculating energy efficiency for a variety of industrial and manufacturing applications.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) has undertaken an effort to refactor legacy tools that were written for the Windows platform into a modern environment. The legacy tools were written in a variety of programming languages, and the source code considered proprietary. This meant that updating them was a difficult task. \r\n\r\nAMO’s tools help manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems. Learn step-by-step ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility. Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and Superior Energy Performance certified.\r\n\r\nApplication:\r\n* Enhanced: Badges in PHAST and PSAT to give more details, try hovering over them\r\n* Enhanced: Managing of modifications in PHAST and PSAT\r\n* Updated: Assessment examples on startup\r\n* Added: Starting tutorial\r\n* Changed: Now using \"Scenario\" instead of \"Modification\"\r\n* Enhanced: Report graphs\r\n* Added: Selecting data wanted for the reports\r\n* Changed: MEASUR branding\r\n* Enhanced: Various Pre-Assesment enhancements\r\n\r\nPHAST:\r\n* Added: Different result units for PHAST\r\n* Added: Totals for PHAST losses\r\n\r\nCalculators:\r\n* Added: Compressed Air Calculators\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n* The mac and linux releases have significantly slower app start times than in previous builds"

The legacy tools were written in a variety of programming languages, and the source code considered proprietary. This meant that updating them was a difficult task. \r\n\r\nAMO’s tools help manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems. Learn step-by-step ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility. Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and Superior Energy Performance certified.\r\n\r\nApplication:\r\n* Added: Ability to edit Explore Opportunities Modification name (PSAT/PHAST)\r\n* Enhanced: Explore Opportunities styling (PSAT/PHAST)\r\n* Added: Date to list view of assessments/folder\r\n* Added: Facility information to folders\r\n* Added: Scroll bar in various locations\r\n* Added: Button navigation (PSAT/PHAST)\r\n* Changed: Styling for tabs and legends for more content space\r\n* Changed: Saving data on changes without delay\r\n* Added: Functionality for moving and renaming Assessments and Folders\r\n* Added: Ability to add Pre-Assessment to folder\r\n* Added: Rollup graphs to print view\r\n* Enhanced: Printing process\r\n* Added: Ability to export graphs as images\r\n* Added: Working grid view for assessment dashboard\r\n\r\nPSAT:\r\n* Updated: Export CSV functionality with new inputs\r\n* Added: Saving Head Tool, Pump Curve, and System Curve data within assessments\r\n* Added: Ability to model Premium Efficient motors\r\n* Changed: Use Premium Efficiency motors for optimization instead of Energy Efficient\r\n\r\nPHAST:\r\n* Changed: Wording from \"Furnace\" to \"Process Heating\" (PH)\r\n* Enhanced: Various areas of help text\r\n* Enhanced: Handling of Endothermic/Exothermic heat\r\n* Changed: Disclaimer text\r\n* Added: Indication for invalid results if losses have warnings or errors\r\n* Added: Report graphs to print view\r\n\r\nCalculators:\r\n* Added: Compressed Air - Bag Method\r\n* Enhanced: General calculators styling\r\n* Added: Icons for calculators list\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n* The mac and linux releases have significantly slower app start times than in previous builds"

      "body": "# A software tool for calculating energy efficiency for a variety of industrial and manufacturing applications.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) has undertaken an effort to refactor legacy tools that were written for the Windows platform into a modern environment. The legacy tools were written in a variety of programming languages, and the source code considered proprietary. This meant that updating them was a difficult task. \r\n\r\nAMO’s tools help manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems. Learn step-by-step ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility. Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and Superior Energy Performance certified.\r\n\r\nApplication:\r\n* Enhanced: Home page styling\r\n* Added: Cash flow diagram for cash flow calculator\r\n* Added: Percent load estimation calculator\r\n* Fixed: Many bug fixes, mostly in PHAST\r\n\r\nPSAT:\r\n* Added: Results panel for assessments screen comparing baseline modification\r\n* Added: Sankey tab\r\n\r\nPHAST:\r\n* Fixed: add new materials modals and updated styles\r\n* Added: Indicator for required losses that are completed\r\n* Added: Support for Metric/Imperial unit logic for Furnace Calculators\r\n* Enhanced:  Graphs and styling for Furnace Calculators\r\n* Fixed: Work flow for heat balance\r\n* Added: Naming losses functionality\r\n* Added: Additional button navigation\r\n* Added: Help text for new material modals.\r\n* Added: Calculators tab with furnace calculators\r\n* Added: Input Data tab to furnace reports\r\n\r\nReports:\r\n* Added: Rollup Reports for Furnace and Pump assessment comparisons\r\n* Fixed: Sidebar navigation\r\n* Added: Collapse top summary functionality\r\n* Improved: Performance for gathering assessments and data\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n* Incomplete furnace assessments will cause instability due to new input fields being required. To ensure stability, make sure to save the assessment before attempting to view the Report / Diagram / Sankey.\r\n* Old assessment data from previous app versions in general may cause issues, it is safest to delete old data and create new assessments after each update"

      "body": "# A software tool for calculating energy efficiency for a variety of industrial and manufacturing applications.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) has undertaken an effort to refactor legacy tools that were written for the Windows platform into a modern environment. The legacy tools were written in a variety of programming languages, and the source code considered proprietary. This meant that updating them was a difficult task. \r\n\r\nAMO’s tools help manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems. Learn step-by-step ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility. Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and Superior Energy Performance certified.\r\n\r\nAdded for v0.2.4-beta:\r\n* Redesigned landing page and tab setup\r\n* Show proper error messages in PHAST when user input doesn't make sense\r\n* Add view factor graph image under view factor calculation on the Opening Losses screen\r\n* Remove enforcement of various PHAST temperature minimums\r\n\r\nChanges for v0.2.4-beta:\r\n* PHAST Sankey diagrams in the report are now stacked vertically rather than horizontally, and are better designed to more easily show small losses\r\n* Enhance the D3 visuals / labels with respect to existing graphs in PSAT / Pumps\r\n* Improve default help text accuracy\r\n* Other UI Style Enhancements\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n* Incomplete furnace assessments will cause instability due to new input fields being required. To ensure stability, make sure to save the assessment before attempting to view the Report / Diagram / Sankey.\r\n* Old assessment data from previous app versions in general may cause issues, it is safest to delete old data and create new assessments after each update"

      "body": "# A software tool for calculating energy efficiency for a variety of industrial and manufacturing applications.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) has undertaken an effort to refactor legacy tools that were written for the Windows platform into a modern environment. The legacy tools were written in a variety of programming languages, and the source code considered proprietary. This meant that updating them was a difficult task. \r\n\r\nAMO’s tools help manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems. Learn step-by-step ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility.

      "body": "# A software tool for calculating energy efficiency for a variety of industrial and manufacturing applications.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) has undertaken an effort to refactor legacy tools that were written for the Windows platform into a modern environment. The legacy tools were written in a variety of programming languages, and the source code considered proprietary. This meant that updating them was a difficult task. \r\n\r\nAMO’s tools help manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems. Learn step-by-step ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility. Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and Superior Energy Performance certified.\r\n\r\nAdded for v0.2.2-beta:\r\n* PHAST Reports\r\n* Printing for multiple assessments\r\n* Conversions for PHAST Calculations in metric\r\n*  Implementation costs for PSAT\r\n\r\nChanges for v0.2.2-beta:\r\n* O2 Enrichment graph updates, now makes more sense and gives more information\r\n* Other UI Enhancements"

      "body": "# A software tool for calculating energy efficiency for a variety of industrial and manufacturing applications.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) has undertaken an effort to refactor legacy tools that were written for the Windows platform into a modern environment. The legacy tools were written in a variety of programming languages, and the source code considered proprietary. This meant that updating them was a difficult task. \r\n\r\nAMO’s tools help manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems. Learn step-by-step ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility. Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and Superior Energy Performance certified.\r\n\r\nAdded for v0.2.1:\r\n* New furnace diagram\r\n* Sankey diagram for furnaces\r\n* Simple report for furnaces\r\n* More help text, including minimum and maximum values \r\n\r\nChanges for v0.2.1:\r\n* Moved motor calculators to their own section\r\n* Updated print styles\r\n* Modifications to the calculators for electrotechnology furnaces\r\n* General bug fixes"

      "body": "# A software tool for calculating energy efficiency for a variety of industrial and manufacturing applications.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) has undertaken an effort to refactor legacy tools that were written for the Windows platform into a modern environment. The legacy tools were written in a variety of programming languages, and the source code considered proprietary. This meant that updating them was a difficult task. \r\n\r\nAMO’s tools help manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems. Learn step-by-step ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility. Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and Superior Energy Performance certified.\r\n\r\nAdded for v0.2.0:\r\nAdditional units for unit converter\r\nAdds a PSAT diagram\r\n\r\nChanges for v0.2.0:\r\nUpdated synchronization around the auto-update, ensures consistent updating\r\nSome fields for losses were added and others removed.\r\nScale limits for Specific Speed Calculator\r\nUnit labels for PHAST inputs, values not currently being converted"

The legacy tools were written in a variety of programming languages, and the source code considered proprietary. This meant that updating them was a difficult task. \r\n\r\nAMO’s tools help manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems. Learn step-by-step ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility. Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and Superior Energy Performance certified."

The legacy tools were written in a variety of programming languages, and the source code considered proprietary. This meant that updating them was a difficult task. \r\n\r\nAMO’s tools help manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems. Learn step-by-step ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility. Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and Superior Energy Performance certified."

The legacy tools were written in a variety of programming languages, and the source code considered proprietary. This meant that updating them was a difficult task. \r\n\r\nAMO’s tools help manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems. Learn step-by-step ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility. Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and Superior Energy Performance certified."

The legacy tools were written in a variety of programming languages, and the source code considered proprietary. This meant that updating them was a difficult task. \r\n\r\nAMO’s tools help manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems. Learn step-by-step ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility. Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and Superior Energy Performance certified."

      "body": "# A software tool for calculating energy efficiency for a variety of industrial and manufacturing applications.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) has undertaken an effort to refactor legacy tools that were written for the Windows platform into a modern environment. The legacy tools were written in a variety of programming languages, and the source code considered proprietary. This meant that updating them was a difficult task. \r\n\r\nAMO’s tools help manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems. Learn step-by-step ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility. Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and Superior Energy Performance certified."
